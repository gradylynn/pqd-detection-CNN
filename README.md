# Power Quality Disturbance Prediction with Convolutional Neural Networks
## _Research by Grady Lynn, advised by Dr. Talayeh Razzaghi from the University of Oklahoma_

This repository is for the research that I began in the Spring 2020 semester with Dr. Razzaghi at the University of Oklahoma.
The goal of our research is to use convolutional nerual networks to detect and classify Power Quality Disturbances (PQDs) in power grids.

Some of the starting places for our research are papers listed below:
- Shouxiang Wang, Haiwen Chen, "A novel deep learning method for the classification of power quality disturbances using deep convolutional neural network"
- R.Igual, C.Medrano, F.J.Arcega, G.Mantescu, "Integral mathematical model of power quality disturbances"

The pqmodel.m was found [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/6kmkk9bjdx/1) and is used to simulate different classes of power quality disturbances used for training our model.
